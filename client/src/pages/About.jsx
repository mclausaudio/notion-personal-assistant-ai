            <p>Hello!  My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mclausaudio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Claus</a>.  I'm a software engineer based in San Francisco, CA.  I'm a huge fan of <a href="https:/www.notion.so" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Notion</a>, and I use it for everything from my personal to-do lists and journal, to managing my professional projects.  I wanted to create a tool that would help me streamline my Notion workflow, and I thought it would be a fun to combine my love of Notion with my interest in AI.  Thus, this project was born!</p>

            <p>My goal for building this project was to gain experience building with LLMs and not desinging / building UI.  The app uses the LangChain to create a prompt and make an API call to OpenAI's LLM.  LangChain makes developing with OpenAI's LLMs very easy.  I especially enjoyed working with some of the libraries prompting tools, although I found writing the actual prompt itself to be tricky and require lots of tweaking.</p>
            <p>One challenge I faced was getting the model to provide a predictable output that I could concistently work with programmatically.  Rather than trying to get the model to return JSON, I decided to have it split up the data with pipes <code>|</code> and then split the string to create an array.</p>
            <p>I learned a lot while building this project and I have lots of ideas of how I can extend it.  If you have any ideas or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mclausaudio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
            <p>I hope you enjoy using this tool as much as I enjoyed building it!</p>
