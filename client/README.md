## Running the Application

## Application Features

1. Settings Tab: Here you can input your OpenAI API Key, Notion API Key, and Notion Database ID. These are required for the app to make the necessary API calls to OpenAI and Notion. Don't worry, we do not store these details.
2. Save Keys: You can choose to save your API keys and Database ID in your local storage. This ensures you don't have to re-input them every time you use the application.
3. Input Field: You can enter your thoughts and tasks into the input field. The AI will process this input and write it to your Notion database.
