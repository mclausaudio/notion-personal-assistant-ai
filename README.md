For a more detailed guide on using the application, please refer to our 'How it works' section of the homepage.

## Motivation

I'm a huge fan of <a href="https:/www.notion.so" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Notion</a>.  I use it for everything from my personal to-do lists and journal, to managing my professional projects.  I thought it would be fun to create a tool that would help me streamline my Notion workflow by using OpenAI's LLMs and thus, this project was born!</p>

## Structure

This project is composed of two main parts:

1. Client: This is the frontend of the application, built using React.
2. Server: This is the backend of the application, built with Express. This server handles the API calls to both OpenAI and Notion.

The client directory contains the code for the frontend (React app), while the server directory houses the backend (Express app) code.

To understand more about the individual components, their setup, and their usage, please refer to the README files in the respective directories.

I hope this project inspires your productivity workflows.  Thanks for checking it out!
